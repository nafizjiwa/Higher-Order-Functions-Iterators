# HigherOrderFunctions<br>

| | JavaScript operator that takes three operands|
|---|---|
| .forEach() | used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns undefined. |
<br>
.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
.findIndex() returns the index of the first element of an array that satisfies a condition in the callback function. It returns -1 if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition.
.reduce() iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value.
All iterator methods take a callback function, which can be a pre-defined function, a function expression, or an arrow function.
