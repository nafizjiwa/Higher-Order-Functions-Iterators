# Higher Order Functions and Iterators <br>

| Iterator Method | Descriiption of Iterator Method|
|---|---|
| array.forEach() | used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns undefined. |
| array.map() | executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements. |
| array.filter() | checks every element in an array if it meets criteria and returns a new array with the elements meeting truthy for the criteria. |
| array.findIndex() | returns the index of the first element of an array that satisfies a condition in the callback function. It returns -1 if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition. |
| array.reduce() | iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value. |
| All iterator methods take a callback function which makes them higher order functions  |

that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result.
